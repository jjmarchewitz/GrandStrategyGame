# GrandStrategyGame

A grand strategy game for Ethan and I to have fun with

Steps to setup
1. Install Python 3.9.X (Any version of 3.9, I used 3.9.5)
2. Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
3. Run "./start.sh" in the command line to update and start the game
    1. If this doesn't work, you can execute the game directly using:
        1. Windows - "python main.py" (Must be in a python 3 environment or only have python 3 installed)
        2. Mac - "python3 main.py"

To automatically format a python file to follow the PEP-8 code standard, use
"python -m autopep8 file.py --in-place"
